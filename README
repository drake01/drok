About the name: DROK= drake + grok
=====================================
drake - My Internet pseudonym. For details see the blogpost by me.

grok- From the JargonFile (version 4.4.7) meaning

" To understand. Connotes intimate and exhaustive knowledge. When you claim to
?grok? some knowledge or technique, you are asserting that you have not merely
learned it in a detached instrumental way but that it has become part of you,
part of your identity. For example, to say that you ?know? {LISP} is simply to
assert that you can code in it if necessary ?  but to say you ?grok? LISP is to
claim that you have deeply entered the world-view and spirit of the language,
with the implication that it has transformed your view of programming.  Contrast
{zen}, which is similar supernal understanding experienced as a single brief
flash."

Story of where it came from:
==============================
This is my personal distro I have been using for a while now. I created by compling  the
softwares from free sources downloaded off the internet. The softwares used are the stable
versions available at the time I started with the project (feb,2012).
The  sense of achievement one gets after being able to run a full operating
system created from the files written in high level languages for the pieces of
hardware is what inspired me to create(or build) it. The name and share with everbody else
are secondary.

BUGS:
=====
1) For now the user has to copy the files and create the /proc, mount the /dev
himself by mounting the /dev currently in use by the user.
TODO: Automate it for the release.

2) drok uses the grub as the bootloader which is currently not automated. So the
user has to install, update grub himself if one wants to run the system.
